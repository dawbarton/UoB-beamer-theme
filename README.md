# University of Bristol presentation theme based on the PowerPoint template

This is a LaTeX Beamer theme based on the 2018 University of Bristol brand guidelines. It can be used with `pdflatex` and `lualatex`, though for the best results use `lualatex`. (It probably works with `xetex` as well with some very minor changes.)

When used with `lualatex` it uses Rockwell and Arial as the primary fonts (you might need to install them separately). If you use `pdflatex` then Concrete and Helvetica are used as the closest alternatives.

See `example-slides.pdf` for example slides and `example-handout.pdf` for an example handout.
